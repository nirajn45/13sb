          Finding a house cleaning service shouldn't have to be a difficult
          experience. But as busy professionals, we were frustrated with the
          energy and effort it took to deal with the phone tags, quote forms,
          and paperwork just to get our place cleaned. So we set out to create
          an experience where identifying, scheduling, and managing a cleaning
          appointment from high-quality, trustworthy and reliable cleaners is
          quick and easy â€” with no contracts or hidden fees and simple to use
          online, or by phone. Founded in 2014 and based out of Chicago, that
          vision became Cleaning.com. Book. Clean. Done. Go ahead, enjoy your
          day..
